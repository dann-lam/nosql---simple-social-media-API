## Description


This is a NOSQL style social media API that allows you to CRUD users, CRUD thoughts, CRUD reactions, and CRUD friends!

Creation of the mongoose models wasn't too bad, although for me that was where some bugs would be created.
Some aspects of route creation were quite familiar, whereas others were quite new, as there were quite a bit of few features that can be incorporated from Mongoose.
Another fantastic and interesting element is seeing how easily these generated objects could be linked to each other, versus traditional SQL Database objects.

It's still quite early and not 100% fully fleshed out.

## Learning Points

Understanding Mongoose itself isn't super challenging, although it certainly performs different from SQL databases.

There are many nuances to pick up and understand.
